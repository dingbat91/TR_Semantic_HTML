			<p>
				tim berners lee dreamt of a world wide web that would be free and
				accessible to everyone. sadly, the modern web is littered with poorly
				designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers
				and users). this often comes down to a lack of understanding around
				different user needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldn’t be too
				difficult. the developers at tech returners news have collated an ‘easy
				wins' checklist for web page accessibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				keep this guide handy… when creating your own websites you can check
				these criteria off the list!

			<h2>accessibility checks</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					heading elements & page titles: html heading elements have been used
					to represent page structure, supporting assistive technologies that
					allow page navigation from heading to heading.
				</li>
				<li>
					re-size text: you can vary text size by using your browser's text
					resize settings (through options or preferences), text-only zoom, page
					zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring styling
					issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.
				</li>
				<li>
					alternative text for images: all images have been given appropriate
					alternative text.
				</li>
				<li>
					javascript independence: where javascript or other scripts are used
					for navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has been put
					in place in case your browser does not support these scripts.
				</li>
				<li>
					colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour
					combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and i have also
					ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.
				</li>
				<li>
					style sheets: if style sheets are not supported or are turned off,
					information on the site can still be accessed and read.
				</li>
				<li>
					forms: forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them
					using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. the form
					labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making
					it easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				by spending just a little more time on getting the building blocks of
				the web right, developers can help create an internet that works for
				everyone.
